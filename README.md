## 90 Days of DSA Roadmap [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nannou-org/guide.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Supsource/90DaysDSA)

**Day 1 & 2 :**  Learn about space and time complexity. One of the most important part of programming is knowing the complexity of the code you writing. 

**Day 3 to 10 :** Learn about recursion and backtracking. One of the most important and most useful
Concepts.

**Day 11 to 30 :**  Learn about the basic data structures ->  

* (i) Arrays 
* (ii)Linked List 
* (iii) Stacks and Queues



```Some important Suggestion from Nishant Chahar >``` *From Now, start giving contests and learn the new concepts that come along the way.
                         You might not do well in the first few but itâ€™s okay! Just keep learning and keep growing.*

**Day 31 to 45 :** Learn about more and a little more complex data structures and algorithms ->

* (i) Searching

* (ii) Sorting { 

                   \1\ Bubble Sort
                   \2\ Insertion Sort
                   \3\ Selection Sort
                   \4\ Merge Sort
                   \5\ Quick Sort
                   
* (iii) Hashmaps

* (iv)Trees 

* (v)Heaps 

* (Vi)Sliding Window

**Day 46 to 70 :**  Learn about DP and Graphs ->  

* (i) Graph -> 


                   \1\ Breadth First Search [BFS]  
                   \2\ Depth First Search [DFS] 
                   \3\ Shortest path from source to all vertices: Dijkstra 
                   \4\  Shortest path from every vertex to every other vertex: Floyd Warshall 
                   \5\  Minimum Spanning tree: Prim \6\  Minimum Spanning Tree: Kruskal  
                   \7\  Strongly connected component kosarajuâ€™s algorithm 
                   \8\ Topological Sort  
                   \9\ Shortest Path from source to all vertices with negative edges: Bellman ford   
                   \10\ Normal DSU   
                   \11\ DSU by rank


* (ii) Dynamic Programming 



**Day 71 to 80 :**  Learn about OOPs (Youâ€™ll get something amazing on this by the time you reach here)


**Day 80 to 90 :**  Some more topics which will help you perform better in online tests 

* (i) Number Theory 

* (ii) Bit Manipulation

* (iii) Tries<br>
